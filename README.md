# Stress-Detection-using-ML

The project is a Machine Learning project that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect whether a person is under stress or not. The goal of the project is to accurately predict the stress level of individuals based on their social media textual posts.

The project was developed using the classical waterfall software development model. The dataset used in the project consisted of social media textual posts posted by individuals and a corresponding binary target variable indicating whether the individual was under stress or not.

To build the model, the dataset was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure that it was suitable for building a machine learning model. The next step was to split the dataset into training and testing sets, using an appropriate split ratio.

The Naive Bayes algorithm was trained on the training set and then evaluated on the testing set to measure its accuracy. The results of the evaluation showed the accuracy of the model in detecting whether a person was under stress or not.

In conclusion, The project has successfully demonstrated the use of the Naive Bayes algorithm in detecting stress levels in individuals based on their social media textual posts. The model developed has the potential to be useful in a real-world scenario, where stress detection is an important factor in mental health and well-being.
